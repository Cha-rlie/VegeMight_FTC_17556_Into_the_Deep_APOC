    // HIIIIII Liz this is Caleb
    // I did some work the previous night
    // So the Robot States now work slightly differently; although I kept the names quite similar
    // So obviously for the new bot the specimen claw is different to the sample claw
    // To get you acquainted with the States, I will let you figure out how the state systems work
    // To find a list of all the states, see RobotState.java


    // Claw closed has a value of 0, Claw opened has a value of 0.36
    // In the IDLE state, the robot has its CLOSED
    // When it goes to pick up a specimen, the claw OPENS, and then HOVERS/Waits until it grabs
    // When the robot GRABS, the robot closes the CLAW
    // THIS CLAW IS ONLY FOR SPECIMENS



    // General Structure below

    // Declare Specimen Claw similar to other subsystems
    // DO NOT USE A CR (Continuous Rotation) Servo - Use a normal servo

    // Declare any necessary variables (You should have 2)

    // Declare Hashmap


    // Constructor to build Specimen Manipulator - INCLUDE HASHMAP HERE

    // Init Claw
    // This is where the default command goes - use setDefaultCommand()

    // Update claw (regular) -> rotation and open/close

    // Toggle Claw

    // Manual Rotation of claw

    // Stupid stuff at the end

    // If you need help, we'll be back soon :D
